1. Create a Program that will multiply two array together
A = [1,2,3,4] B = [7,8,9]
A * B = [(1,7),(1,8),(1,9),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,7),(3,8),(3,9),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9)]


2. Create a program that takes an array and sorts it in ascending order as well as descending order and prints both.
Print the difference between the descending order and asencding order array
Example
arr = [2,5,3,1]
output = [1,2,3,5] [5,3,2,1]
4,1,-1,-4
